# MERN Book Search Engine (Refactor)

## Description

This project refactors and existing Book Search Engine (using Google Books) to use Apollo Client/GraphQL to interface with a MongoDB database on an Apollo Server/NodeJS/Express backend.

The use case for the application itself is to enable users to find and save books they are interested in.

The intent is to apply our learning of MERN concepts, GraphQL, Apollo Server and Client, and code refactoring to a functional MERN application.

- What did you learn?

LESSONS LEARNED: I found how little I understood from the class modules, and it took a significant amount of additional reading and trial and error to get functionality working through GraphQL.  I was able to gain a better understanding of how to use GraphQL and Apollo to implement standardized client/server data interchange.  GraphQL provides a single interface for all data, rather than needing to use multiple web URLs/routes for various functionalities.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

- Clone the repository
- From a terminal, in the top-level directory run `npm run install`
- To run both client and server simultaneously, run `npm run develop`
- The client web-page should open automatically in your default browser.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
